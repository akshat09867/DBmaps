## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.3.2
* R-hub (devel and release)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE:
* `unable to verify current time`
This is a common, transient note in virtualized build environments and is considered safe to ignore by CRAN maintainers.

## This is a new submission
This is the first release of `DBmaps` to CRAN.

The `DBmaps` package provides a metadata-driven framework for simplifying the analysis of data from relational databases within R. It automates the process of discovering join paths, creating executable plans for aggregation and merging, and visualizing the data workflow.

Thank you for your consideration.
