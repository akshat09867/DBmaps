## Introduction
"Defining Table Metadata with table_info()," we learned how to create a rich, tidy metadata table that describes the structure and analytical potential of our source data tables.

This vignette covers the next logical step: using that metadata to automatically generate executable R code. This is a powerful concept known as metaprogrammingâ€”writing code that writes code. 
This automation is key to the DBmaps package, as it allows us to perform complex data transformations based on the simple rules we defined in our metadata.

We will introduce the generate_aggregation_code() function, which reads our master metadata table and produces runnable data.table code strings to perform aggregations.

## Create the Master Metadata
First, we need a master metadata table to work with. The generate_aggregation_code() function requires this as its main input. 
Here, we'll define the metadata for our transactions table, which has multiple outcomes and grouping rules.

```{r transactions-example, echo = TRUE}
# Define metadata for the transactions table
transactions_info <- table_info(
  table_name = "transactions",
  source_identifier = "transactions.csv",
  identifier_columns = c("customer_id", "product_id", "time"),
  key_outcome_specs = list(
    list(OutcomeName = "Revenue", ValueExpression = quote(price * quantity), AggregationMethods = list(
      list(AggregatedName = "RevenueByCustomer", AggregationFunction = "sum", GroupingVariables = "customer_id"),
      list(AggregatedName = "RevenueByProduct", AggregationFunction = "sum", GroupingVariables = "product_id")
    )),
    list(OutcomeName = "UnitsSold", ValueExpression = quote(quantity), AggregationMethods = list(
      list(AggregatedName = "TotalUnitsByCustomer", AggregationFunction = "sum", GroupingVariables = "customer_id")
    ))
  )
)

# For this example, our master metadata only contains one table's info
master_metadata_dt <- transactions_info

cat("Master metadata table created successfully.\n")
```
## Generate Aggregation Code
Now that we have our master_metadata_dt, we can use generate_aggregation_code() to create the code for the transactions table.

```{r aggregation-code-generation, echo=TRUE}
generated_code <- generate_aggregation_code(
  table_name_filter = "transactions",
  metadata_dt = master_metadata_dt
)

# Let's see the code strings that were generated
print(generated_code)
```

As you can see, the function produced two distinct code strings. 
It intelligently grouped the metadata by the grouping_variables column and created one statement for all aggregations by customer_id and another for all aggregations by product_id.

## Execute the Generated Code
The output of generate_aggregation_code() is not just text; it's valid, runnable data.table code. We can execute these strings using eval(parse(text = ...)) to perform the actual data manipulation.

Let's demonstrate this by creating a sample transactions data.table and running one of the generated statements.

```{r runnable-code, echo=TRUE}
# 1. Create a sample 'transactions' data.table
transactions <- data.table(
  customer_id = c("C001", "C002", "C001", "C003", "C002"),
  product_id = c("P01", "P02", "P02", "P01", "P02"),
  price = c(10, 20, 22, 11, 21),
  quantity = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2)
)

# 2. Select the code that aggregates by customer_id
code_to_run <- generated_code["customer_id"]
cat("Code to be executed:\n", code_to_run, "\n\n")

# 3. Parse and evaluate the code string
aggregated_by_customer <- eval(parse(text = code_to_run))

# 4. View the result
cat("Result of execution:\n")
print(aggregated_by_customer)
```

The code was executed successfully! We now have a new data.table, aggregated_by_customer, which contains the total revenue and units sold for each customer. 
This aggregated table is now perfectly structured to be joined with a customers table on customer_id.

## Conclusion
The generate_aggregation_code() function provides a powerful bridge between your metadata definitions and actual data processing. 
By using metaprogramming, you can automate complex data.table operations, ensuring consistency and dramatically reducing the need for manual, repetitive coding.
