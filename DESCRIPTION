Description:
    This package is designed to simplify and automate the exploration, 
    organization, and merging of data stored in relational databases. Instead of 
    manually inspecting schemas and writing complex SQL joins, DBMaps enables you to:
        - Discover and document table relationships
        - Create and maintain a join-map
        - Search for suggested joins
        - Merge data
